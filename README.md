# Algorithms in Python
These Python modules implement various classic algorithms and were created as learning excersises for myself. Anyone is free to use or reference these as desired.

##Sort Algorithms
- [Insertion sort](https://github.com/jongrim/python_algorithms/blob/master/insertion_sort.py)
- [Merge sort](https://github.com/jongrim/python_algorithms/blob/master/merge_sort.py)
- [Quicksort](https://github.com/jongrim/python_algorithms/blob/master/quicksort.py)

## Search Algorithms
- [Binary search](https://github.com/jongrim/python_algorithms/blob/master/binary_search.py)

## Math Algorithms
- Solving for square roots with the [Newton-Raphson](https://github.com/jongrim/python_algorithms/blob/master/newton_raphson.py)
 method.
